## Description

This program prompts the user with a series of questions and then generates a readme file based off the answers the user inputs. This readme was actually made with this very program, and I then made a few additions.

## Installation

You will need to run the following installation commands in your terminal in order to run this program:

npm init -y

## Usage

For usage instructions, please do the following:

Enter node index.js into your terminal. You will then be prompted with a series of questions. Answer each question and it will then generate a readme file titled "auto-generated-readme.md"
